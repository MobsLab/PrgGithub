CORTICAL


try to do analysis synchronized on sharp waves

correlate ReactR with amount of slow oscillations

do analysis of ReactEV, and of react bias, correlate with RateReact

do by-cell and bypair bootstrap of ReactEV, ReactBias



do analysis of ReactRate comparing sharp waves periods with shifted
sharp wave intervals 





HIPPOCAMPAL

redo whole analysis 

redo comparisons of sharp waves/non-sharp waves, and rich/poor using
more appopriate bootstrap methods








compare r-values, slopes for cortex and hippocampus
