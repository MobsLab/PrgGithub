    """
    Filters neurons based on a threshold in their mean firing rate and returns the results for the sorted neurons.

    Parameters:
    - loaded_results (dict): Loaded results containing RÂ² values and other metrics for different models.
    - spike_counts (dict): Dictionary where keys are Mouse_IDs and values are DataFrames of neurons' spike counts.
    - firing_rate_threshold (float): Threshold for the mean firing rate.
    - above_threshold (bool): If True, keeps neurons above the threshold. If False, keeps neurons below the threshold.

    Returns:
    - filtered_results (list): Results of the neurons meeting the threshold criterion.
