# An introduction to Git if needed

[This tutorial](https://freedium.cfd/https%3A%2F%2Fmedium.com%2F%40jake.page91%2Fthe-guide-to-git-i-never-had-a89048d4703a) is a good start to understand the basics of Git.

# Update 2025-02-10

There were some already existing git repos in the PrgGithub folder.
I added them as git submodules in the PrgGithub folder. **If you want to use them you need to give yourself the rights.**
You will find them here :

- [./OnlinePlaceDecoding](https://github.com/MobsLab/OnlinePlaceDecoding.git)
- [./PreProcessing/NomenclatureCodes](https://github.com/MobsLab/PreProcessing.git) - NO longer a git submodule, but a simple copy.
- [./Dima/\_CleanCodeForGit](https://github.com/MobsLab/AnalysisNeuro.git)
- [./Processing](https://github.com/MobsLab/GetFunctions.git) - not updated compared to Dropbox yet : we need to figure the delta wave computation out - NO longer a git submodule, but a simple copy.
- [./Sam](https://github.com/MobsLab/SamMnemozyne.git) - can also be found in the [Mnremozyne repo](https://github.com/MobsLab/Mnemozyne.git), SamMnemozyne branch.
- [./ERC_Codes](https://github.com/MobsLab/Mnemozyne.git)

# PrgGithub

This is our repository for Matlab and Python codes.

## Current state

It would be nice to put a list of general-use codes/functions and their usecase in the [GeneralUseCodes](./GeneralUseCodes.md) file.

## Future

For now it's a full copy of the Dropbox PrgMatlab folder (30/01/2025, 13.00).

The idea would be to progressively commit, delete and clean the codes to make converged versions with better code.

In order to do so, please refer to the [Instructions](./Instructions.md) file.
